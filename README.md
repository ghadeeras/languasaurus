# Languasaurus
![CI Build](https://github.com/ghadeeras/languasaurus/workflows/ci-build/badge.svg?branch=master)

Languasaurus is (eventually going to be) a language recognition tool to construct regular expressions and lexical and syntax analyzers (i.e. scanners and parsers).

To dig into the sub-components of this project:
 * The [Regular Expressions](./docs/RegExes.md) component
 * The [Scanner](./docs/Scanner.md) component
 * The Parser component (not yet implemented)
